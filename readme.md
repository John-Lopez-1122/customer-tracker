Hello, here is some code for a customer tracker. I tried following the requirements the best I could on this one and I think I did well enough. With that, im still confused about loops and may have used them wrong on this. To compensate I made some console.log commands to fix it. Anyway, this took about 30 minutes. Its a bit strange that the assignment says it will take 1-2 hours yet I finished it pretty quick, feels wrong. Please feel free to message me at any time using my email: johnplopez123@gmail.com or through Github. Thank you!
